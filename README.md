# MicroController_Project
A 4-wheeled object controlled by flex sensor and microcontrollers. One microcontroller handles the flex sensor and transmits voltage values, while the other manages the LCD, motors, and IR sensor. The object moves based on the sensor angle: 0° (stop), 45° (forward), 90° (backward).
